- What changes you would make to this interfaces for use in an RTOS
environment?
Using an RTOS for tasks, mutex, interrupts, setting priority, etc. can be done.
Timeout can be used if blocking API used

- How might the I2C API be improved
I2C API needs to be modified as per the datasheet to read and according to the sequence given in the datasheet. 
I didn't modify it. I can modify it if asked for.
